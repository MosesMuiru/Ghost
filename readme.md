user must be in the app in order to view the available riders

riders must maybe click on a button to report for work
    , in order for the the streaming to happen right
    the reporting will help on 
    making sure that the rider streams the current location


    for location
    fetch the current location from your app
    then streamed to you according to your geographic

    
    A user also can stream his location
    when a location is streamed it licked only to the right rider
    this protects the rider 

    rider
    make sure the location is turned off when he is booked already
    when the ride is over, using a special geolocation tracker the location is hidden and removed from the map(cache)



    the implementation
    create an api where
    1. through this it will follow by streaming the currect location with the nearest ride, 
        (todo) "an algorithm that calculates the neareby location"
    2. api that book a ride
    3. stream riders current location
